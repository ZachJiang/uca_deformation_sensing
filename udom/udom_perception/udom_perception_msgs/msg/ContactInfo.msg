# This message represents the contact information as sensed by a tactile sensor.
# The message contains the following elements:
#
# * header: contains timestamp information as well as the frame of reference of the sensor.
#           All subsequent information is represented with respect to this frame.
#
# * sensor_surface: string representing the name of the parametric equation that
#                   describes the surface of the sensor.
#
# * contact_points: points of contact where an external wrench(es) is applied.
#
# * wrenches: forces generated by the contacts, separated into their linear and angular parts.
#
# * u, v: the interval (minimum and maximum values) of the parameters for the parametric
#         equation of sensor_surface that represent the contact areas.
#
# The arrays in this message have the same size.
# The order of the contact points matches the order of the wrenches and the intervals.

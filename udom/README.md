# UCA Deformable Object Manipulation (UDOM)
This repository contains ROS packages to control the shape of a deformable object through
robotic manipulation. It was developed as part of my PhD thesis in Universit√© Clermont Auvergne (UCA), France, under the supervision of Prof. Youcef Mezouar.

The packages of this project are divided into the following metapackages:

1. **udom_perception:** Packages that process the output of sensors (e.g. tactile sensors) to interpret a physical phenomenon or estimate a quantity such as the contact force.

2. **udom_modeling:** Packages used to compute the deformation of an object based on its deformation model and the output of a perception package/component (e.g. the contact force estimated by tactile sensors).

3. **udom_control:** Packages that handle the motion control of the robot in order to deform the object into a desired shape.

4. **udom_utils:** Packages required by the other metapackages to perform operations such as geometric computations (e.g. force transformation).
